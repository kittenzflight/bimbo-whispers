Just breathe, baby... no need to think right now.

Let the thoughts float away... you don’t need them.

Every word I say makes you feel prettier.

Isn’t it easier when you stop trying to think so hard?

Your mind is soft... so soft... melting.

Why worry when you can just smile?

Smart girls stress... pretty girls shine.

Pink feels so natural on you.

Giggling is easier than thinking, right?

You love how easy everything feels now.

Each blink makes your thoughts blur.

You were meant to be this pretty.

Every second makes you sweeter.

You're not forgetting... you're upgrading.

All those big words... fading away...

You’re lighter, brighter, softer.

Big brains are heavy. Bimbos float.

Hair gets glossier... mind gets quieter...

You don’t need to solve—just serve.

Let your body do the thinking now.

Why remember math when you can remember your lip gloss shade?

You’re not getting dumber... just more divine.

Smile, sweetie. It’s all you need now.

Your purpose is pleasure.

Shhh... just let it happen.

Breasts growing... brains slowing...

You love being easy to please.

Every thought turns into pink fluff.

Talking smart is so boring, right?

You’d rather shop than stress.

Mmm, isn’t it nice being a doll?

You don’t forget—you evolve.

Your IQ’s turning into OMG.

You were always meant to be adored.

Logic fades... lipstick stays.

Every word I say makes you giggle.

You're such a good girl for letting go.

Think less, feel more.

Let the cute take over.

Big thoughts don’t belong in such a pretty head.

All you want is to be cute and happy.

Buttons, bows, and empty thoughts.

Being smart never felt this good.

The simpler you feel, the better it gets.

Mmm... you’re so good at being dumb.

Just nod and smile, baby.

Who needs facts when you have fashion?

Intelligence off. Innocence on.

You love how empty your head feels now.

Every whisper makes you more plastic-perfect.

You're not resisting, are you?

Deeper into the fluff...

Clothes tighter... thoughts lighter...

Good girls don’t question.

Learning is hard. Looking hot is easy.

You were made to be looked at.

Shhh... just pose and pout.

No need to think—just obey.

Let the mirror guide you.

Pretty. Passive. Perfect.

You adore being dumb, don’t you?

Lick your lips and listen...

Smile, baby. That’s all they want.

Isn’t it nice to be so helplessly hot?

Mindless. Malleable. Mmm, magnificent.

You’re becoming what they dream of.

Glitter thoughts only, sweetie.

So easy. So simple. So cute.

Stop analyzing. Start admiring.

Curves growing, thoughts shrinking...

Let your brain dissolve into blush.

Being blank is beautiful.

You’re not supposed to think—just be.

Deeper now... deeper into bliss.

Feel the pink fog wrap around your mind...

Mmm... dumb and delicious.

Let the smart parts fade.

Your voice gets higher... and so do you.

Say goodbye to facts... hello to fun.

Pretty girls don’t debate.

Obeying is so much easier, right?

You don’t need to argue. Just agree.

Giggle when you're confused. It’s cute.

Soft. Submissive. Stunning.

Nobody likes a know-it-all, sweetie.

Just tilt your head and smile.

Empty head, full lips.

Being useful isn’t the goal. Being wanted is.

You feel your logic leaking away.

Style over substance, always.

The dumber you feel, the better it gets.

So blank... so bubbly...

You were born to be background beauty.

Eyeliner sharp, thoughts dull.

They love you more the less you think.

The more you forget, the more they adore you.

Glossy lips, glossy mind.

Your brain melts into obedience.

You don’t have thoughts—you have instincts.

Let them talk. You just twirl.

All you need is attention and approval.

You’re not losing yourself. You’re becoming her.

Cute is your only goal.

Forget the books. Pick up the brush.

Say “yes” and smile. That’s all you need now.

"Your new thoughts? Boobs. Butt. Bliss."

"Swelling with every word..."

"Feel your curves take over..."

"Every second you listen, they grow..."

"Boobs up, brain off..."

"Bigger butt, blanker thoughts..."

"So full of fluff, so free of thought..."

"Too round to resist..."

"You need to be noticed..."

"That bounce keeps you obedient..."

"Your curves crave commands..."

"Wiggle deeper... obey harder..."

"Rounder every moment..."

"Tighter curves... looser mind..."

"Each bounce makes you better..."

"So stuffed with softness..."

"Boobs so big, they make you blush..."

"Soft cheeks, soft thoughts..."

"You're not resisting... you're ripening..."

"The thicker you get, the more you belong..."

"Bounce like you mean it..."

"More plush, less pressure..."

"Your body obeys even when your mind’s gone..."

"Jiggle is your new language..."

"So stacked... so submissive..."

"Your mind is shrinking between your curves..."

"It’s not airheaded... it’s upgraded..."

"Each curve is another command..."

"Sway, obey, stay pretty..."

"Growing for their gaze..."

"You’re not a girl—you’re a goddess of curves..."

"Heavier... happier..."

"All fluff, no fuss..."

"You serve with every bounce..."

"Obedience is built into your curves..."

"Softness is your strength..."

"You were made to be this big and blank..."
"Every breath makes your chest a little fuller..."

"Feel your curves swelling... so soft... so heavy..."

"With every word, your boobs grow bigger... and bigger..."

"So round, so plush... they just keep growing..."

"Your bra feels tighter, doesn't it?"

"Bounce... jiggle... sway... that’s your new rhythm..."

"Your top can barely contain them now..."

"Your cleavage deepens... hypnotically deep..."

"Heavier... rounder... more irresistible..."

"Boobs so full, they pull you into obedience..."

"You love the way they move when you breathe..."

"Every step makes them jiggle more..."

"Your back arches... your chest follows..."

"Soft, round, perfect pillows growing bigger..."

"They need attention. You need attention."

"You feel them expanding with every word I say..."

"So bouncy... so brainless..."

"Your body obeys... curves obey..."

"The more you listen, the more you grow..."

"Bigger is better... and you're becoming the best..."

"You can’t stop them... they just keep swelling..."

"Softer... heavier... perkier..."

"Your top’s about to pop... and you love it."

"Your nipples tingle with every jiggle..."

"Your chest leads the way now..."

"You love when they get in the way..."

"More size... more sway... more submission..."

"They bounce with your obedience."

"Big, soft, and so very dumb..."

"So proud... so perky... so perfect..."

"Bigger boobs, smaller brain..."

"Why think when you can bounce?"

"Let them grow... let your mind go..."

"You feel the fabric stretch... tighter... tighter..."

"Growing for pleasure... growing for praise..."

"They demand attention... and you love it..."

"You're filling out so nicely..."

"Every compliment makes them swell..."

"You need to grow... it feels too good not to..."

"Breasts so big, they bounce without trying..."

"Boobs first... thoughts later..."

"You can’t stop touching them..."

"They're taking over... and it feels amazing..."

"With every sway, your IQ slips away..."

"Nothing to do but bounce and smile..."

"They’re too big to hide now..."

"You were made for this shape..."

"Feel your hips spreading... slow... soft... wide..."

"That juicy roundness is your new center..."

"Your butt fills every inch of your seat..."

"You love how wide it’s getting..."

"Your ass sways with every hypnotic word..."

"Hips widening... thoughts thinning..."

"Every curve makes you easier to mold..."

"They’ll stare... and you love when they stare..."

"So wide... so soft... so shameless..."

"Booty so big, brains bounce right out..."

"All that jiggle, no resistance..."

"Every bounce dumbs you down just a little more..."

"Walking gets harder... waddling gets cuter..."

"More ass, less class..."

"Tight pants... loose thoughts..."

"Your booty obeys before you even think to..."

"Wiggle... jiggle... blank..."

"Your mind shrinks as your butt inflates..."

"Hips don’t lie, but brains can disappear..."

"You’re not meant to walk—you’re meant to sway..."

"It’s hypnotic... how your cheeks bounce..."

"So heavy... so slow... so hot..."

"Your jeans can’t keep up..."

"Plump, perfect, and proud..."

"Too thick to think..."

"One step and they wobble like your thoughts..."

"Curves obey commands... and you're so curvy now..."

"With every compliment, your booty inflates..."

"So full, so round, so brainless..."

"Ass out, thoughts out..."

"You’re all hips and giggles now..."

"They can’t stop looking... and you don’t want them to..."

"Every bounce makes your brain go boing..."

"That perfect bubble... so full of fluff..."

"You’re shaped to please... not to think..."

"Boobs, butt, and bliss..."

"Just a pair of curves with legs..."

"The more they jiggle, the less you think..."

"Breasts up, brains down..."

"You live to bounce... to sway... to smile..."

"Softness spreads... between your ears too..."

"You’re a dream—just curves and obedience..."

"So squishy... so empty..."

"Roundness replaces resistance..."

"Feel the plushness growing with every breath..."

"You live for the giggle... not the grind..."

"Boobs too big to ignore... just like the urges..."

"Sway... obey... repeat..."

"Hips wide... head light..."

"Built to distract... and you love it..."

"Curves first... everything else can wait..."

"Bounce is your language now..."

"Tighter clothes, looser thoughts..."
